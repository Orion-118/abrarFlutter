# cs310-basic-demo

_Sample from [flutter-codespaces](https://github.com/dilanx/flutter-codespaces)_

This is a basic Flutter app demo used during the CS 310 class. It allows you to enter a URL into a text field. Upon submitting, it reads from a remote server, receiving JSON that includes text and a link to an image. It then displays the text and image on the screen.

See the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IFnTc89Z6bZIKABzfuFHSnKlkShCVB2pwuVPeQbHfPI/edit?usp=sharing).

Here are some URLs you can use in the app to test it out (they're the same ones from class):
- https://cdn.dilanxd.net/hello.json
- https://cdn.dilanxd.net/sink.json
